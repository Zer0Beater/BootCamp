Input Event Practice

It's time to practice working with the input event!  In the index.html file, you'll find an <h1> and an <input type="text"> element.  Please do not change anything in index.html!  In app.js, write code that meets these requirements:

    The h1 should start with the text "Enter Your Username" (I've done that for you, already in the markup)

    Whenever an input event is fired on the <input> element, update the <h1> so that it displays "Welcome, " plus the current value from the text input.  Take a look at the gif below to see how it should work.

    If the <input> goes back to being empty, update the <h1> so that it once again says "Enter Your Username"

Animated demo for the Input Event Practice exercise: the page starts with the heading "Enter Your Username" above a text input. As the user types in the input, the heading updates immediately to "Welcome, " followed by the current input value. When the input is cleared, the heading changes back to "Enter Your Username".

Note: In the gif you can see the h1 is updating as I type, rather than whenever I leave the input.  Be sure to listen for an input event, rather than a change event.  Rewatch the previous video for more information!
